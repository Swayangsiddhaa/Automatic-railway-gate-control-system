This project aims to automate the process of
railway gate control, which traditionally
depends on human operators, thereby
minimizing errors and enhancing safety.
Using an Arduino UNO, ultrasonic sensors
detect the arrival and departure of trains.
Servo motors control the gates, while LEDs
and a buzzer provide visual and audio
signals. The project successfully automates
gate control, improving safety and efficiency.
This system could be further enhanced with
advanced sensors and IoT integration for real-time monitoring.
